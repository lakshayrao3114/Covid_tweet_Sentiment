# COVID Tweet Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
The COVID Tweet Sentiment Analysis project aims to analyze the sentiments of tweets related to COVID-19. The primary objective is to categorize tweets into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral.

## Project Components

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Various Parameters

### 2. Data Pre-processing
Data pre-processing has been conducted to clean the data, making it easier and more efficient for the algorithms to process. The steps include:
   - Removing noise and irrelevant information
   - Normalizing the text
   - Tokenizing the text
   - Removing stop words
   - Stemming or lemmatizing the text
   

### 3. Machine Learning Algorithms Used
Several machine learning algorithms have been employed in this project to classify the sentiments of the tweets. These include:
   - **Na√Øve Bayes**
     
   - **Logistic Regression**
     
   - **Random Forest**
     
   - **XGBoost**
     
   - **CatBoost**
     

### 4. Libraries Used
The following libraries were used in the project:
   - **Pandas**
     
   - **WordCloud**
     
   - **Matplotlib**
     
   - **Seaborn**
     
   - **Nltk**
     
   - **Sklearn**
     
   - **Numpy**
     

## Results
The results of the sentiment analysis show the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral tweets, providing insights into public opinion on COVID-19 based on Twitter data.

## Conclusions
   - Majority of the tweets were around 250 characters long, indicating a high level of interest in COVID-19 among the general public.
   - More neutral tweets than positive and negative tweets were posted globally.
   - The United States had the highest number of tweets, followed by India.
   - Words like "covid19", "case", "pandemic", "deaths", and "trump" were used the most, indicating that people were aware of the pandemic and actively discussing it online, particularly in the United States.
